 * Descriptions:
 * 		In the environment: the shop Tesco Express, John (agent: customer1) infected
 * 		with the coronavirus is shopping. The porter Mike (agent: staff) checks if the
 * 		number of customers has reached its limit to determine whether to let in another
 * 		customer Rachel (agent: customer2) who is healthy. Whether or not that John coughs
 * 		depends on a random belief.
 * 
 * For more information about this example, see
